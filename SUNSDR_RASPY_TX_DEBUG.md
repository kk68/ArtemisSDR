# SunSDR Raspy TX Debug Tracker

Date started: 2026-04-14

## Problem

Intermittent raspy tone/audio during SunSDR TUNE and MOX/TX. Current report is roughly 50-60% occurrence. Working hypothesis: a stream timing or state-transition sync issue around active TX entry, TX keepalive, and RX silence padding.

## Current Status

- Status: instrumentation added, waiting for repeated TUNE-cycle data.
- Primary file: `Project Files/Source/ChannelMaster/sunsdr.c`
- First reproduction target: repeated TUNE on/off cycles, 2-3 seconds on and 2-3 seconds off.
- Keep this tracker updated after every test or code change until the issue is resolved.
- Commit and push every meaningful stable checkpoint to `kk68/feature/sunsdr2dx`. Do not push to upstream `ramdor/Thetis`.

## Instrumentation Added

The 2026-04-14 pass added diagnostics for:

- TX attempt boundaries: `TX_ATTEMPT_BEGIN`, `TX_ATTEMPT_0x06_SENT`, `TX_ATTEMPT_END`
- first active TX packet timing: `TX_FIRST_FD`
- TX packet sequence and interval metrics: active `0xFD` count, sequence gaps, gap min/avg/max
- keepalive races: `TX_KEEPALIVE_RACE`, `feDuringTx`, `keepaliveRaces`
- read-thread feed rates: `txFeed`, `keepaliveFE`, `rxSilence`, `realFE`, `realFD`, `xrouterReal`, `xrouterTotal`, `rxAccum`

The incomplete placeholder `extern double rx_silence_accum_public;` was removed. Real source-0 packets now debit the local RX silence accumulator during TX so the diagnostic path can expose overfeed.

## How To Test

1. Build `ChannelMaster` Debug x64.
2. Start Thetis with SunSDR2 DX selected.
3. Confirm RX is working before TX tests.
4. Run at least 10 repeated TUNE cycles:
   - TUNE on for 2-3 seconds.
   - TUNE off for 2-3 seconds.
   - Record each attempt number as clean or raspy.
5. Collect `sunsdr_debug.log`.

## What To Compare

For clean vs raspy attempts, compare:

- `TX_ATTEMPT_END ... feDuringTx`
- `TX_ATTEMPT_END ... keepaliveRaces`
- `TX_ATTEMPT_END ... firstFdDelayMs`
- `TX_ATTEMPT_END ... fdGapMin/fdGapAvg/fdGapMax`
- `TX_ATTEMPT_END ... seqGaps`
- per-second `IQ status` fields during the attempt, especially `rxSilence + realFD` versus expected feed behavior

## Current Hypotheses

- If `feDuringTx > 0`, an idle `0xFE` packet crossed into active TX and should be treated as the highest-priority fix.
- If `firstFdDelayMs` is large or inconsistent on raspy attempts, consider pre-priming one active `0xFD` silence packet around `0x06=1`.
- If `rxSilence + realFD` overfeeds WDSP during TX, finish/tune the RX silence accumulator logic.
- If none correlate, expand diagnostics into VAC/ASIO and Thetis TX audio routing.

## Verification So Far

- `git diff --check -- Project Files/Source/ChannelMaster/sunsdr.c`: passed.
- `MSBuild ChannelMaster.vcxproj /t:ClCompile /p:SelectedFiles=sunsdr.c`: passed with 0 warnings and 0 errors.
- Full `ChannelMaster` link from this invocation failed because `PA19.lib` is searched under `Project Files/Source/build/x64/Debug`, while the existing dependency libs are under `Project Files/build/x64/Debug`.

## Next Step

Run the repeated TUNE-cycle test and update this file with:

- number of attempts
- clean/raspy classification for each attempt
- key log correlations
- the next chosen fix candidate
